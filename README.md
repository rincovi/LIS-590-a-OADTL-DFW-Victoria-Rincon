# LIS-590-a-OADTL-DFW-Victoria-Rincon "(weekly reflections)"
**Week One Reflection 06/26/2023**

For some context I will be working with the Open Access Digital Theological Library with Tom Phillips and Ann Hidelago and this log will serve as place to keep track of what we are doing, my progress, and thoughts. Originally I was going to do this via WordPress but I was advised that GitHub may be a better option. (Also I found WordPress to be a bit frustrating to use so perhaps this was a better alternative in the long run) I was very nervous about starting this DFW but This morning I meet with Ann Hidalgo today alongside Lily Woodard "(my fellow DTL intern, she's awesome)". Our meeting was about an hour and during the first half Ann walked us through some of what we will be doing this summer with the OADTL. I was a bit nervous but the meeting was an overall success, except for one issue. When it was time to create our accounts and follow along with Ann I never received the email activating it. I wish we could have stayed longer but I had to leave for work. Luckily Ann offered to meet with me on Tuesday. I am looking forward to creating my own digital collection and I am glad I decided to do a DFW this summer so I can obtain on-hand knolwedge even though my experiences with tech are very few and far in between and I do not necessarily trust my abilities with technology

I met with Ann eariler and I got the email that helped me set up my OCLC account which was great. I was a bit worried that it still wouldn't work but luckily crisis averted. Ann showed me how under the metadata tab to search for titles add to a collection in OCLC and the proper process for checking metadafrom the identifiers (Internet Archive OADTL) to make sure they matched we went through an example I did alongside her and then did two by myself with her watching. I was surprised with how easy the process was but this is only our first lesson and there is still more to learn. Our homework for this week is to find more titles to add to the collection from this process we just learned and we are meant to have another meeeting this Friday. I also think that I need to figure out what is happening with my GitHub when I type there is a huge delay between what I am typing  and when it appears on screen. Am I typing to fast for it to keep up?

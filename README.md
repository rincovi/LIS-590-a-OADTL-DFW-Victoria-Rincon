# LIS-590-a-OADTL-DFW-Victoria-Rincon "(weekly reflections)"
**Week One Reflection 06/26/2023**

For some context, I will be working with the Open Access Digital Theological Library with Tom Phillips and Ann Hidelago, and this log will serve as a place to keep track of what we are doing, my progress, and my thoughts. Originally I was going to do this via WordPress, but I was advised that GitHub may be a better option. (Also, I found WordPress to be a bit frustrating to use, so perhaps this was a better alternative in the long run) I was very nervous about starting this DFW, but This morning I meet with Ann Hidalgo today alongside Lily Woodard (my fellow DTL intern, she's awesome). Our meeting was about an hour, and during the first half, Ann walked us through some of what we will be doing this summer with the OADTL. I was a bit nervous, but the meeting was an overall success, except for one issue. When it was time to create our accounts and follow along with Ann, I never received the email activating it. I wish we could have stayed longer, but I had to leave for work. Luckily Ann offered to meet with me on Tuesday. I am looking forward to creating my own digital collection, and I am glad I decided to do a DFW this summer so I can obtain on-hand knowledge even though my experiences with tech are very few and far in between, and I do not necessarily trust my abilities with technology.

**06/27/2023**

I met with Ann earlier, and I got the email that helped me set up my OCLC account, which was great. I was a bit worried that it still wouldn't work, but luckily crisis averted. Ann showed me how under the metadata tab, to search for titles to add to a collection in OCLC and the proper process for checking metadata from the identifiers (Internet Archive OADTL) to make sure they matched; we went through an example I did alongside her and then did two by myself with her watching. I was surprised by how easy the process was, but this is only our first lesson, and there is still more to learn. Our homework for this week is to find more titles to add to the collection from this process we just learned, and we are meant to have another meeting this Friday. I also think that I need to figure out what is happening with my GitHub. When I type, there is a huge delay between what I am typing and when it appears on the screen. Am I typing too fast for it to keep up?

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Week Two Reflection 07/08/2023**

I ran into a few hiccups before adding more to the collection, but luckily after looking at my notes, and remembered I was supposed to remove the checkmark for the “My Selected Titles” filter. I wish I realized it a bit sooner because it took me a very confused ten minutes to finally realize what was happening. After that was settled, I was able to find titles like Anne showed me. I made sure I was in the Metadata tab and kept the default settings in the collection manager section with my data type as “collection” and my scope as “my selected collections.” After that, I typed in my search term “free to read,” and the Internet Archive came up as a result. I selected it, and from I started my quest. I promised myself this week that I would try to find at minimum 10-20 titles to add to the collection, which I knew would not be the easiest task considering many have already been added by previous students in this DFW. I also tried to space out the amount of time it would take to undergo this task throughout the week. After a few tries of finding a term that had titles that were not in the collection yet, I finally got results for the term “gnostic. Only one page of results came up, but I found a few that were not selected yet. I made sure that I looked through what was available and that they were relevant to the OADTL. When I found one, I copied the OCLC number and pasted it into the OADTL search bar, and compared it to the scanned copy and metadata on the Internet Archive website. From this search, I selected four that seemed relevant and moved on to another term, “superstition.” I only found one (a volume 3 out of 4 about totemism by Frazer) that I could select, a lot of the titles were repeats with one copy already added to the collection. I then used “superstitions” as my next term, which yielded way more results. It’s a little funny how much the difference is just by making the term plural, I found eight. Lastly, taking inspiration from my first successful search, I used the term “totemism” and found three. 

Friday (July 7th), we had our meeting with Ann again. It went well, we talked about how the first week of work went. Homework is the same, and we are supposed to have another meeting on Monday morning. We also discussed a small scare I had. I deselected a title, and when it disappeared from the list of titles, I thought I accidentally deleted it altogether. Turns out no, it was still there, and deselecting does not delete things from the Internet Archive! I feel relieved and a bit silly about the whole thing. We also talked about duplicates of books and whether we should add them, and we were told it was fine so long as they don't have the same website link. I think this time, I am going to find ten more titles but try to stick to one key term or closely related key terms.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Week Three 07/09/2023-07/15/2023**

Slight change; this week, we are creating our own collections. (Yay!). Last Monday morning (07/10/20203) Ann showed Lily Woodard and me how to create collections in the OADTL in conjugation with not only World Cat but also academic and institutional repositories with dissertations. According to Ann this is important for two reasons: 1. Because they are helpful for other students and 2. because they provide a cluster of sources that have been vetted and put through the peer review process. A lot of these university repositories are open-access, which is great, and we were initially going to start with using UNAM, an extremely popular open-access repository from the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México. Anne explained the importance of adding foreign language resources. WorldCat may not have the same open-access materials as UNAM due to not being as popular in Latin America, and we need both WorldCat and a repository like UNAM to create these collections. Ann also informed us of the importance of having bilingual researchers in order for a collection to grow. However, I was not confident in my knowledge of the Spanish language and was given the option to use eScholarship (a repository established by the University of California) in order to proceed with the exercise. 

Like last time Ann walked us through the process, and I'll recount it here like I did last week's log. First, we click "Create Collection" and keep the default collection type as "Knowledge Base Collection." Then when naming the collection, we have to follow the same convention that shows where the collection is coming from and what the topic is. In my case, it was DTL OA eScholarship (UC) Open Access Dissertations in Folklore, a collection ID will be generated, and the attributes must have "Open Access" checked off. You must write a description of the collection, and you have the option to write notes, and although they can both be changed later, a description must be written during the creation process that explains what the collection is, where the dissertations are from, and who curates it. Under the "Holdings and MARC Records tab, we are supposed to keep the default for "use institution settings" and allow ILL and enable MARC record delivery. Everything else should be kept the same. 

Once the collection is created, you can begin adding titles. First, you go to the repository, and after typing your topic (i.e., folklore) in the search, select theses. We found this really interesting thesis on Voodoo and zombies in cinema and used that for this run-through. With Ann instructing me, I copied and pasted the title into the DTL (WorldCat) to see if it was there, when it appeared, we examined the metadata 
 to compare the author, title, and year and they all matched. We did see under "Access Online" that it already was in the DTL but in another collection centered around religious studies, but was assured that it was fine to continue. I copied the OCLC number and the collection, clicked add "Add Local Title" and used the "Create Using OCLC Number to Pre-fill" in the drop-down box. Next, I set the "Coverage Depth" to "Ebook" and added the title URL, after that, it was ready to go.
 
Our assignment this week is to add more dissertations to our newly established collection. My only concern at the moment is not finding enough that falls within the topic I chose. There are plenty on eScholarship that are about folklore, but finding dissertations pertaining to folklore AND related to religion has me a bit worried. It should be fine, though, right?

Anyway, it took a few hours, but I now have ten titles in my collection. I tried to attach a screenshot to this log, but I am not sure if it will work. If not, I'll add it to the documents folder. I am looking forward to our next meeting on Monday. I think I did a good job, but I think there are a few questions I should ask Ann. It was a bit late to ask, but I should have asked for clarification if I could add titles that were not in the OADTL, all of the ones I picked were but as a part of different collections. I know she said it was fine when we were doing the together, and perhaps it is just me being insecure, but I cannot help but think that I did some part of this wrong.

**Week 4 07/23/2023**

A bit late with this week with my log, I am not sure what is happening but I've been feeling sick since Wednesday. I think I am mostly over it now, and I was able to still get my fieldwork done. This log is also going to be a bit shorter than the last week.

Anyway, last Monday, our meeting with Ann was much shorter. I was the only one there because Lily was sick, and we mostly  went over the midterm report that was due on 07/18, and I was glad to get it done early. My assignment for this week was to add more titles to my collection. Last week due to my misunderstanding, I limited myself to titles that were already in the OCLC and DTL, but as a part of a different collection but this time around, I widen my net more. By using the same process from last week (refer to last week's log), I found ten more titles to include in my collection, and I purposely added titles that were not already a part of the OCLC or found in the DTL. There was something that caught my attention while I was working. When there were duplicates in the DTL, some of them were labeled as a Thesis Dissertation, and others were labeled as Downloadable Archive Material. I made that I got the OCLC numbers from these because that was what we suppose to be gathering, but what are these downloadable materials? Can we add those too, or is that going to be something we are going to tackle at a later date?

We have another meeting with Ann tomorrow morning, perhaps I can bring that up with her. I also want to know if we can make another collection or if this collection on folklore is the one I will be working with for the rest of the DFW. If so, I won't be upset about it, but it would be a good thing to know. I added screenshots of my collection with the new titles into the documents folder, but I include them here too. This time there are two photos.

**Week 5 (07/23/2023-07/29/2023)**

I missed the meeting on Monday with Ann but managed to reschedule for the following Friday on the 28th. It went well. I got my question about downloadable archive materials answered, and we can use them (Hooray!) This week was a bit rough, but I still managed to pull it off. I created a brand new collection in the OCLC  about art with Ann. I expressed concerns about not being able to find more titles and how my count was low in comparison to collections made by other students. We went through the process again, and we realized that last time when creating my last collection, I didn't select a provider. Luckily caught it this time for the new collection, and I was also able to go back and edit the other one to include a provider (selected eScholarship (California Universities), by the way). I tried to make sure that my titles were expressly art related because there were some that, although had the word "art" in them, didn't mean that it was pertaining to the subject of the arts, like this one about the "art of bodily anatomy or the "art" of politics. I have gathered 50 titles for the collection, and when creating it, I saw that there were three other related collections but none specifically for art history. Should I have specified more? Are that grounds to create another collection? I'll ask Anne next time I see her. I am a bit concerned about doing my DFW for week 6 since I'll be heading home to Baton Rouge for my mom's birthday. Most of Monday and Tuesday, I'll be preparing for the trip, Wednesday evening after work, I'm catching my plane, and then Thursday, when I finally get there at 6 am, I'm going to be wrapped up in the festivities. I just don't want to have to rush to get this done or do a bad job. I think I'll voice my concerns to Ann too, just in case. Especially since I'm not leaving until Sunday afternoon and unsure if I'll be there on time for the next Monday morning meeting. Below I'm going to include some screenshots I took but one thing I haven't been able to figure out is why the screenshots in week three are links but the ones in week 4 display as actual pictures, and why can't I make the text in week 2 stop being in bold? What did I do differently?

**Week 6 (07/30/2023-08/05/2023)**
I noticed last week when I was working on the art collection I saw that there was no collection specifically for art history. I'm really liking this one and I want to keep working with it. I did come across some of the same titles as last week but I did find some awesome new titles. In total my collection has forty-six titles and I'm trying to see if I can add some more later on. This week was not the easiest time to work, I had to spend a lot of time getting ready to leave Seattle for Baton Rouge and spent an entire day traveling. I do have some questions again for Anne when we meet next week on Monday, mostly about the articles in the DTL and how the authors are listed. I mean, they are accurate, the titles match, the dates match, and the authors match too but there is a difference I notice when it came to that last one. Although the actual author of a title will always be consistently shown in the "byline?" there are names of contributors present in some but not in others, sometimes their names are only mentioned in the notes. In eScholarship, these non-author names are listed as advisors and in DTL as contributors with some variations of a title. When that happens the title is not listed as a thesis dissertation but as downloadable archive materials, which we've established as fine to use. However, this has me wondering if I have been prioritizing the wrong version of titles. Maybe I am overthinking it and it is all fine but just in case I'm going to ask Ann about it. I'm excited about next week too we are going to learn something new! Evaluations are coming up soon, which has me a little nervous. Also a bit nervous I'll miss the next meeting on Monday morning since I'll be flying all night Sunday. Keep my fingers crossed on that matter.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Week 7 (08/06/2023-08/12/2023)**
This was not a good week, at least it doesn't feel like it is. When I got back to Seattle it was extremely late at night and in a few hours, I had to go to the weekly meeting with Ann and Lily. I felt like a zombie the entire time, even at work and all week felt like I had to catch up. Our meeting was a bit shorter this time and the instructions for this week's activity could be watched on a video (I'll put the link below) Ann shared with us and Lily was kind to check in to see if I was feeling alright. Ann said this activity was optional but we were shown how to make a KBART sheet which can be used to create a knowledge base using a spreadsheet. Ann says these would be very useful if a collection was purchased from a publisher and they send sheets with information about the books. I can use the template to create a collection without putting it in one title at a time.

Before doing that I add just a few more titles to my collection but I think I am now at the point where it is harder to find relevant dissertations. I am starting to wonder if creating a collection specifically for art history was a mistake. I am debating if I should combine the two somehow considering that my Art and Art History collections contain roughly the same amount of titles. Perhaps I could just add the titles from the Art History collection that aren't present in the other one? The other question I need to think about is would that be the best use of my time? I need to work on Assignment 5 which, to be honest, takes priority.

Anyway, before creating a KBart file you need to make sure that you have the proper requirements. According to the video one thing you need to look at before starting is the action field. The values in an action field tell the system how to handle the titles and their files that will be uploaded to the collection. Raw means you are adding new titles to a local knowledge base collection, and autofill means adding to the collection via KBART file uploads, the collection manager will use OCLC numbers and look for titles in WorldCat to pre-fill the data for these titles. The latter sounds very similar to what I have been doing for the last few weeks, just doing it one at a time. We did not follow the video to the letter, we downloaded the titles, which created a txt. file. Next, we had to open it in Excel, this part took some time due to me getting a brand new computer, needing to redownload Microsoft Office again, and figuring out how to open a txt. with the program but I got it eventually. Before we made any changes we created a training collection in OCLC for the exercise. In the spreadsheet we had to make two changes, we had to change the current collection ID number from the Art History collection and replace it to the new training one, and we also had to change our action field from raw to autofill. Then we changed the file back to a txt. document pressed collection actions, and selected upload titles. What I did not anticipate was how long it would take for the upload to finish and did not take a screenshot of the report pop-up or the notification saying it was uploading. I do have a screenshot of the collection's page with no titles. which I'll attach below. When we did the walk-through that collection only had five titles and mine currently has fifty-four, that could be why it's taking some time. If it finishes later I'll add another screenshot afterwards.

**Later**
After a few hours, it worked! I showed it to Anne this morning (8/14/2023) and she said it looked great!

**Week 8 (08/13/2023-08/19/2023)**
I have mixed feelings about this week. Not bad ones, of course, I'm mostly just relieved that I completed my collections but also a bit sad about my DFW being over. So in this last log, I will go over what I did for my last week. On Monday we had our last meeting with Ann and talked about our collections and what we were going to turn in. Ann showed us how we were supposed to publish/ promote our collections but stressed to make sure our properties were all correct before putting it out, once it was it would not really be possible to go back and fix it. You can still make edits while the promotion request is still pending but once it goes through, not possible. Currently, all of my collections are still pending but I am happy with them. Ann also assured us that the subject matter of our collections was perfectly fine and also offered to be a reference for Lily and me. 

When it came to my collections, in the end, I published four collections. My folklore collection and three others that covered the subject of the arts. The first one was a general collection, I chose any title that was about the arts from dance, paintings, and music to topics like pedagogy and art movements. If it was relevant to the arts overall I picked it. Then there was my art history collection, it was a bit tougher. Lily assured me that art history was a wide topic but I tried to be as selective as I could and I think I succeeded in making sure they were all relevant. In my last log, I was debating whether or not to combine the two collections, especially since I was feeling a bit anxious about the art history collection. In the end, I decided not to, and funny enough the night I was going to submit my collections I ended up creating another one. I figured this is the DTL and I couldn't forgive myself if I didn't make at least one collection that was related to religion. So I made a collection about religion in the arts and I think I did pretty well with that too, but I combed through each article to make sure they were relevant. Also, any articles I didn't see in my first art collection that happened to be in these two newer ones I ended up adding them which boosted my number of titles from 50 to 93. It was stressful but I'm happy with my work and I'm glad I had this experience. All that is left to do now is focus on my reflection.

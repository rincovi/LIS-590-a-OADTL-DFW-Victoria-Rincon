# LIS-590-a-OADTL-DFW-Victoria-Rincon "(weekly reflections)"
**Week One Reflection 06/26/2023**

For some context, I will be working with the Open Access Digital Theological Library with Tom Phillips and Ann Hidelago, and this log will serve as a place to keep track of what we are doing, my progress, and my thoughts. Originally I was going to do this via WordPress, but I was advised that GitHub may be a better option. "(Also, I found WordPress to be a bit frustrating to use, so perhaps this was a better alternative in the long run)" I was very nervous about starting this DFW, but This morning I meet with Ann Hidalgo today alongside Lily Woodard "(my fellow DTL intern, she's awesome)". Our meeting was about an hour, and during the first half, Ann walked us through some of what we will be doing this summer with the OADTL. I was a bit nervous, but the meeting was an overall success, except for one issue. When it was time to create our accounts and follow along with Ann, I never received the email activating it. I wish we could have stayed longer but I had to leave for work. Luckily Ann offered to meet with me on Tuesday. I am looking forward to creating my own digital collection and I am glad I decided to do a DFW this summer so I can obtain on-hand knowledge even though my experiences with tech are very few and far in between and I do not necessarily trust my abilities with technology

I met with Ann earlier, and I got the email that helped me set up my OCLC account, which was great. I was a bit worried that it still wouldn't work, but luckily crisis averted. Ann showed me how under the metadata tab, to search for titles to add to a collection in OCLC and the proper process for checking metadata from the identifiers (Internet Archive OADTL) to make sure they matched; we went through an example I did alongside her and then did two by myself with her watching. I was surprised with how easy the process was, but this is only our first lesson, and there is still more to learn. Our homework for this week is to find more titles to add to the collection from this process we just learned, and we are meant to have another meeting this Friday. I also think that I need to figure out what is happening with my GitHub. When I type, there is a huge delay between what I am typing  and when it appears on the screen. Am I typing too fast for it to keep up?

*Week Two Reflection 07/08/2023**

I ran into a few hiccups before adding more to the collection, but luckily after looking at my notes, and remembered I was supposed to remove the checkmark for the “My Selected Titles” filter. I wish I realized it a bit sooner because it took me a very confused ten minutes to finally realize what was happening. After that was settled, I was able to find titles like Anne showed me. I made sure I was in the Metadata tab and kept the default settings in the collection manager section with my data type as “collection” and my scope as “my selected collections.” After that, I typed in my search term “free to read,” and the Internet Archive came up as a result. I selected it, and from I started my quest. I promised myself this week that I would try to find at minimum 10-20 titles to add to the collection, which I knew would not be the easiest task considering many have already been added by previous students in this DFW. I also tried to space out the amount of time it would take to undergo this task throughout the week. After a few tries of finding a term that had titles that were not in the collection yet, I finally got results for the term “gnostic. Only one page of results came up, but I found a few that were not selected yet. I made sure that I looked through what was available and that they were relevant to the OADTL. When I found one, I copied the OCLC number and pasted it into the OADTL search bar, and compared it to the scanned copy and metadata on the Internet Archive website. From this search, I selected four that seemed relevant and moved on to another term, “superstition.” I only found one (a volume 3 out of 4 about totemism by Frazer) that I could select, a lot of the titles were repeats with one copy already added to the collection. I then used “superstitions” as my next term, which yielded way more results. It’s a little funny how much the difference is just by making the term plural, I found eight. Lastly, taking inspiration from my first successful search, I used the term “totemism” and found three. 

Friday (July 7th), we had our meeting with Ann again. It went well, we talked about how the first week of work went. Homework is the same, and we are supposed to have another meeting on Monday morning. We also discussed a small scare I had. I deselected a title, and when it disappeared from the list of titles, I thought I accidentally deleted it altogether. Turns out no, it was still there, and deselecting does not delete things from the Internet Archive! I feel relieved and a bit silly about the whole thing. We also talked about duplicates of books and whether we should add them, and we were told it was fine so long as they don't have the same website link. I think this time, I am going to find ten more titles but try to stick to one key term or closely related key terms.
